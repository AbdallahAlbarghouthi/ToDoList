2- Functionality goes as follows:
2.1- Chores are added by user using text box
2.2- Insetion is done with either the insertion button or by pressing "Enter"
2.3- Chores are then listed under the My To Do List H2 header
2.4- User is then able to either remove or make the Chore as done.
2.5- Done Chores are listed in the bottom under the Is Done H2 Header.
